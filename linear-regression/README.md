# Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting.

### Assumptions of Linear regression
1. **Linear relationship**: There exists a linear relationship between the independent variable, x, and the dependent variable, y.

2. **Independence**: The residuals are independent. In particular, there is no correlation between consecutive residuals in time series data.

3. **Homoscedasticity**: The residuals have constant variance at every level of x.

4. **Normality**: The residuals of the model are normally distributed.
